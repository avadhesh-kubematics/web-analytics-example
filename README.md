# Web Analytics Example (under development)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joumenharzli/web-analytics-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joumenharzli/web-analytics-example)

## Overview
This is an example of web analytics and recommendations using Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Apache Cassandra, Spring Boot and Angular 5

## Architecture

## Running the example

### Requirements
This example requires:
* jdk 1.8.0_162
* Apache Kafka 0.11.0.2
* Apache Cassandra 2.2.11
* Apache Storm 1.1.1

### Configuration (currently)
* Access logs in the example are broadcasted via the topic <b>product-access-topic</b>. So you need to create it in Kafka.
* We need also to prepare the Cassandra column families and keyspace. Please insert the following lines
```cql
create keyspace web_analytics WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };

use web_analytics;

create table products_access_log(id UUID PRIMARY KEY, userId text, productId text, timestamp timestamp);

create table products_views_total(productId text PRIMARY KEY, count counter);

create table products_views_by_timestamp (productId text, timestamp timestamp, count counter, primary key (productId,timestamp) ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (timestamp desc);

create table products_views_by_user (productId text, userId text, timestamp timestamp, count counter, primary key (userId, productId,timestamp) ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (productId desc);

```

### Then what ? (currently)
* Connect to the swagger interface in the shopping microservice via ```http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html```
* Invoke the list of shops api then list of products in shops then get the product by it's id
* A message will be boardcasted to Kafka wich holds the access log of the product
* Apache Storm will parse the received data from Kafka then process them and saves the results in Cassandra
* Check Cassandra to see the processed data

### Results (currently)
* You can check that everything is working by viewing data in Cassandra
